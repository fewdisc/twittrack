I know when I use Twitter, typically during the day it's on my iPad or PC at work, then during the evening I move to my iPhone or Mac.

I was thinking that you could start to build up an idea of where people are just by looking at their tweets, the source of them and the time of day.

This could be useful, perhaps in a social engineering engagement or maybe just to be nosey!

== steps ==

1. clone repo
2. initialise the sqlite db: ./twittrack --setup
3. run it with a twitter handle as the argument:

./twittrack marcwickenden

== then what ==
At the moment you will need to query the sqlite db manually

sqlite3 db/twittrack.db
SELECT created_at, source from tweets where screen_name = 'marcwickenden'
